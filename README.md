# Greening Research In Tacoma
This repository comes from data obtained by The Nature Conservancy and the Tacoma Tree Foundation. The purpose of this project is to explore the efficacy of tree canopy coverage in urban environments at reducing local temperatures. The neighborhood studied in Tacoma has more pavement and less trees than the city average. Such neighborhoods in Tacoma have found to create a heat islands leading to temperatures up to 6Â°F over the city baseline. 

All relevant raw data for this project can be found in the 'data' folder. All [data cleaning, standardization,](https://github.com/jackdda/GRIT/blob/main/Jack%20Didier%20Cleaning%20and%20Analysis/AugTempBlitzSanitization.ipynb) and [analysis](https://github.com/jackdda/GRIT/blob/main/Jack%20Didier%20Cleaning%20and%20Analysis/AugTempBlitzAnalysis.ipynb) done by Jack Didier has been put in the "Jack Didier Cleaning and Analysis" folder of the repository.
